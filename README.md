# Description

This project contains a program built with the LC-3 assembly language. It serves as a test score calculator, displaying the minimum, maximum, and average score from a provided set of numbers, alongside its corresponding letter grade. The significance of this program is that it allows teachers and students an insight into how the students are doing in the class. This will allow school districts to change the curriculum based on students' performance. As well as allowing students to keep track of their grades.

# Instructions

### For the best results possible, please:
- Keep values between 0 and 100
> A system is in place that will prevent input above that, prompting the user to try again until their value is valid.
- Write values across *three* digits
> Zeros should be used to fill any extra space(s).</br></br>
> For example, 3 should be entered as 003, 27 should be entered as 027, and so on and so forth.
- Completely reload the program to use it again
> This program will only execute once. To prevent any problems with future runs, click "Reinitialize Machine" in the LC-3 simulator (or its equivalent elsewhere) and open the program from your files once more.

Thank you for reading!
