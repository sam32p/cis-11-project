# Description

This project contains a program built with the LC-3 assembly language. It serves as a test score calculator, displaying the minumum, maximum, and average score from a provided set of numbers, alongside its corresponding letter grade.

*Code walkthrough soon...*

# Instructions

### For the best results possible, please:
- Keep values between 0 and 100
> A system is in place that will prevent input above that, prompting the user to try again until their value is valid.
- Write values across *three* digits
> Zeros should be used to fill any extra space(s).</br></br>
> For example, 3 should be entered as 003, 27 should be entered as 027, and so on and so forth.
- Completely reload the program to use it again
> This program will only execute once. To prevent any problems with future runs, click "Reinitialize Machine" in the LC-3 simulator (or its equivalent elsewhere) and open the program from your files once more.

Thank you for reading!
